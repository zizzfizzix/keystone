# Schema Extension

!> This page covers the basics of schema extension in Keystone Next but still needs work to cover
the topic fully. Please reach out to us at [@KeystoneJS](https://twitter.com/keystonejs) with your
feedback and questions!

Keystone Next generates an **executable GraphQL Schema** based on your app's schema, which is then
made available through the GraphQL API.

This lets you create your own **custom GraphQL Types, Queries and Resolvers** with logic that's
specific to your app. You can also integrate external services into your schema as if they were
built into Keystone, and even use other GraphQL libraries like [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org) with
Keystone seamlessly.

Some of the things you can do with this include:

- Expose queries with hand crafted filters and logic, e.g to find the most popular posts
- Build business logic for e-commerce shopping carts, ordering and payment processing
- Expose data from database views, aggregate queries, the file system, or any async function
- Consolidate data from external systems through a unified GraphQL schema
- Integrate with third-party services like Algolia for search results that return Graph data from
  Keystone
